`q2 · i?` · `design · r2`

Baseline comparison in the Results section: a Random Forest regressor and classifier using only response length as predictor were trained alongside the full models. The length-only baseline "performs poorly compared to other models" on both formulations.

> "We also observe the Random Forest baseline, which uses only number of words as predictor, performs poorly compared to other models, justifying the dependence of scores on other features introduced previously."
